## Support meetings

Each group must participate in least two 45 minute support meetings, one prior the markdown presentation and one prior the final presentation. Support meetings take place during the regular seminar slot, with two support meetings scheduled per slot. Support meetings will be scheduled on October 27 and November 24, respectively. If necessary, each group can request one additional 45 minute support meeting in one of two project work blocks. Given the limited time available the group should prepare a set of concrete questions, which should be submitted at least 24h prior to the support meeting.    

## Presentations

During the course, each group will give four presentations, two project pitches, one markdown presentation, and one final presentation. These presentations serve two important purposes. First, they will help you advance and track the progression of your project and invite helpful feedback from other seminar participants. Second, they provide valuable opportunities for practicing the communication of data analytic projects in various formats. The maxim for these presentations is to tell good stories that inform and entertain the audience.
